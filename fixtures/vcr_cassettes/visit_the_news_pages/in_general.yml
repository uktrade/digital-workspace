        direct investment<\/a> (<abbr title=\"Foreign Direct Investment\">FDI<\/abbr>)
        projects than ever before for the year 2016 to 2017.<\/p>\n<p>With more than
        2,200 projects recorded, the post-referendum figures show an increase of 2%
        on the previous year. The data also shows that 75,226 new jobs were created,
        and 32,672 safeguarded, amounting to over 2,000 jobs per week across the country.<\/p>\n<p>Overall,
        the UK is the number one destination for inward investment in Europe, with
        the technology, renewable energy, life sciences and creative industries all
        seeing an increase in the number of projects.<\/p>\n<p>International Trade
        Secretary, Dr Liam Fox, said:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Almost one year on since
        the EU referendum, the UK continues to attract record levels of inward investment
        and remains extremely attractive to foreign investors.<\/p>\n<p>As an international
        economic department, we continue to promote the strengths of the UK as a great
        inward investment destination, with an open, liberal economy, world-class
        talent and business-friendly taxation.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Overview<\/h2>\n<p>Of
        the record number of projects that the UK attracted, the Department for International
        Trade helped to secure over 80% of them.<\/p>\n<p>The US retains the top spot
        investing in 577 projects in the UK, with China (including Hong Kong) remaining
        in second place with 160 projects. In third place is France with 131 followed
        by last year\u2019s third place India and Australia and New Zealand with 127
        projects each.<\/p>\n<h2>Government support for investment<\/h2>\n<p>As part
        of the government\u2019s drive to attract inward investment, in January this
        year the department launched a major global marketing campaign &#8211; <a
        href=\"https:\/\/invest.great.gov.uk\/int\/\" rel=\"external\">Invest in GREAT
        Britain and Northern Ireland<\/a> &#8211; to promote the UK\u2019s offering
        to international investors.<\/p>\n<p>To date, the campaign has generated 1.4
        million page views of the invest section of the great.gov.uk digital service
        and recorded over 540 prospective investor enquiries. It is already producing
        positive results with Chinese e-commerce company Kuajing.com opening a London
        office and UpCloud, a Finnish cloud hosting company, setting up a UK base
        with plans in place to expand this \u2013 both investment decisions that were
        made after engaging with the campaign.<\/p>\n<h2>Investment across the UK<\/h2>\n<p>Looking
        across the UK, inward investment continues to spread to the regions and devolved
        administrations:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Northern Powerhouse attracted 348 projects,
        creating nearly 15,000 new jobs<\/li>\n<li>the Midlands Engine attracted 223
        projects which resulted in 8,341 new jobs being created<\/li>\n<li>through
        183 <abbr title=\"Foreign Direct Investment\">FDI<\/abbr> projects, 5,547
        new jobs were created in Scotland<\/li>\n<li>Northern Ireland secured 34 projects,

        Fox champions global free trade"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>I would like to
        begin by thanking <abbr title=\"American Enterprise Institute\">AEI<\/abbr>
        for hosting us today, and for the warm welcome we have had here in the US.<\/p>\n<p>As
        the UK prepares to leave the European Union, Britain enters a new chapter
        in our history.<\/p>\n<p>We will do so as a proud champion in the cause of
        global free trade, unashamedly promoting the importance of the rules-based
        system, and helping to ensure that the proceeds of prosperity are distributed
        to all.<\/p>\n<p>This is a global responsibility, and not one that Britain
        can realise alone.<\/p>\n<p>To achieve our ambition at home, we will seek
        a full and comprehensive trading relationship with our European neighbours,
        retaining the ties of commerce, standards and shared interests that have long
        united us.<\/p>\n<p>Yet we will also set our sights wider, strengthening our
        ties with new friends and old allies alike, as we seek to build a truly global
        Britain.<\/p>\n<p>As far as our own trading relationship with the EU goes,
        we begin from a mutually advantageous position.<\/p>\n<p>Never before have
        2 parties seeking a new trade agreement begun with the advantages of complete
        regulatory equivalence and a zero tariff environment.<\/p>\n<p>Our challenge
        is not primarily economic, but practical and political.<\/p>\n<p>At all stages,
        whether at the <abbr title=\"World Trade Organization\">WTO<\/abbr> in Geneva,
        ensuring the transitional adoption of existing EU agreements into UK law,
        or passing trade legislation through Parliament, we will strive to ensure
        stability, continuity, and no disruption to market access.<\/p>\n<p>And throughout
        this process, our overriding aim is to provide maximum predictability and
        transparency not only to businesses and consumers alike, but to our international
        partners also.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time we must ensure that government works
        together with those in our economy that drive our prosperity.<\/p>\n<p>This
        year marks 2 centuries since David Ricardo introduced his Theory of Comparative
        Advantage.<\/p>\n<p>As everyone here will know, the theory states that, if
        nations are allowed to engage in free and open trade, specialising in the
        export of certain goods and the import of others to meet their needs, then
        there is a mutual increase in economic welfare between nations, making those
        countries richer as a result.<\/p>\n<p>It is one of the most powerful concepts
        in economics, described by the economist Paul Samuelson as the only proposition
        in all the social sciences that is both true and non-trivial and remains,
        to this day, the most fundamental justification of the power of free trade.<\/p>\n<p>Since
        1817, the world has changed beyond all recognition, yet the experiences of
        globalisation, and of technological advances unimaginable in Ricardo\u2019s
        time, have only served to validate his theory.<\/p>\n<p>The principles of
        free and open trade have underpinned the multilateral institutions, rules
        and alliances that helped rebuild post-war Europe and the world beyond.<\/p>\n<p>They
        helped usher the fall of communism and the tearing down of the Iron Curtain;
        they facilitated 70 years of global prosperity, and they have raised the living
        standards of hundreds of millions of people across the world.<\/p>\n<p>Commercial
        liberalism imparts vast economic benefits, but there is also a robust moral
        case for promoting free trade which we must constantly reiterate.<\/p>\n<p>As
        the world\u2019s developing and emerging economies have liberalised their
        trade practices, prosperity has spread across the globe, bringing industry,
        jobs and stability where once there was only poverty.<\/p>\n<p>According to
        the World Bank, the 3 decades between 1981 and 2011 witnessed the single greatest
        decrease in material deprivation in human history \u2013 a truly remarkable
        achievement.<\/p>\n<p>Take India as an example. In 1993, around 45% of India\u2019s
        population sat below the poverty line, as defined by the World Bank. In 2011
        it was 22%.<\/p>\n<p>It is no coincidence that in the intervening period India
        embraced globalisation and started to liberalise its economy.<\/p>\n<p>It
        is hard to imagine an international aid programme, even one as generous as
        our own, that would, or could, have ever been as effective.<\/p>\n<p>It is
        also, sadly, easy to find examples of where a lack of free trade has harmed
        the most vulnerable. If you want to see the contrasting results of open and
        closed economies then look across from China to the Korean peninsula.<\/p>\n<p>In
        1945, both North and South Korea began from a very similar base, but while
        South Korea was eventually more embracing of open trade and free markets,
        Pyongyang turned inwards with the tragic consequences for its citizens that
        we see to this day.<\/p>\n<p>Seoul is now at the heart of a thriving economy
        and dynamic democracy where freedom and prosperity are shared among its people.<\/p>\n<p>It
        should come as no surprise that while over 80% of South Koreans have access
        to the Internet, less than 0.1% of North Koreans enjoy the same. More tragically,
        there is a greater than 10 year discrepancy in the life expectancy of those
        north and south of the demilitarised zone.<\/p>\n<p>Yet for all its humanitarian
        benefits, the value of free trade also lies in its promotion of commercial,
        industrial and economic interests.<\/p>\n<p>As Adam Smith famously observed,
        free trade appeals not to one\u2019s benevolence, but to the idea that prosperity
        is achieved when we are at liberty to pursue our own interests. It just so
        happens that we have many shared interests, ones sought by the UK and US alike.<\/p>\n<p>It
        is perhaps a clich\u00e9 for a British Secretary of State to come to the US
        and talk about the Special Relationship.<\/p>\n<p>Yet the fact that a phrase
        is well-used does not make it any less true.<\/p>\n<p>Britain and America
        are united by language, culture, history, defence and of course commerce and
        trade.<\/p>\n<p>It is perhaps fortuitous that we are also the world\u2019s
        first and fifth largest economies.<\/p>\n<p>The economic value of our bond
        cannot be overstated.<\/p>\n<p>The USA is the UK\u2019s largest export market
        and second largest import market. In 2016 trade between the UK and the USA
        amounted to around $227 billion.<\/p>\n<p>The stock of investment we hold
        in each other\u2019s economies currently stands at $1 trillion. The US is
        the number one destination for UK investment \u2013 thousands of British firms
        have a presence in the US, from car companies to financial services.<\/p>\n<p>US
        companies investing in the UK see a familiar environment, built on economic
        fundamentals which allow businesses to flourish.<\/p>\n<p>They are attracted
        by our low tax and low regulation economy; universities which sit alongside
        their American counterparts in all global top-10 lists; a highly skilled and
        educated workforce; a cutting edge research environment; and the ability to
        operate in the perfect time zone for global trading.<\/p>\n<p>These fundamentals
        will not change; the UK will always be open for business.<\/p>\n<p>In fact,
        the importance of this sentiment is embodied in the fact that one year ago,
        my Department for International Trade was founded to promote Britain\u2019s
        exports abroad, attract inward investment, formulate trade policy, and protect
        our closest trading relationships.<\/p>\n<p>Our task is to build a Britain
        that strengthens our commercial ties with friends and allies across the world,
        utilising Britain\u2019s newly independent trade policy to create new opportunities
        for British businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Yet this will not come at the expense of
        our European partners.<\/p>\n<p>Britain wants the EU to succeed. There will
        be no closing off of relations, economic or otherwise, and no abdication of
        our responsibilities. Continuity and stability will be our watchwords.<\/p>\n<p>But
        any who are tempted to see our exit from the EU as evidence of Britain looking
        inwards should think again. We have just chosen another path \u2013 to embrace
        the wider horizons of a truly global Britain.<\/p>\n<p>As we contemplate our
        new place in the world, we do so with a renewed confidence and optimism, acknowledging
        the vast opportunities that lie before us, especially when it comes to strengthening
        our connection with our single largest trading partner.<\/p>\n<p>My department
        recognises how important our relationship with the USA is.<\/p>\n<p>That is
        why we have established a US-UK Trade and Investment Working Group, dedicated
        to comprehensively strengthening our bilateral relationship.<\/p>\n<p>As a
        priority, the working group will seek to provide stability, certainty and
        confidence for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. Indeed, the first
        discussions will focus on providing commercial continuity as the UK leaves
        the EU.<\/p>\n<p>But our ambitions are much wider. The working group is designed
        to provide a springboard, laying the groundwork for a comprehensive free trade
        agreement between our 2 nations post-Brexit \u2013 the start of a new and
        exciting chapter in our special relationship.<\/p>\n<p>As well as strengthening
        our international relationship, DIT is also working to build upon the tens
        of thousands of local commercial ties that bind our 2 countries.<\/p>\n<p>Tomorrow,
        I will launch a report that details the UK\u2019s trade and investment relationship
        with each of the 435 Congressional Districts within the United States.<\/p>\n<p>The
        report will detail each district\u2019s goods and services trade flows with
        the UK, identify how many jobs are supported by these investments, and detail
        the top UK companies in each district.<\/p>\n<p>For the first time, each member
        of the House of Representatives will have a snapshot of the importance of
        UK trade to their district. Equally, we will be able to see where the opportunities
        lie to strengthen our existing partnerships or forge ahead with new, mutually
        beneficial, ones.<\/p>\n<p>We believe that an open, free, and fair trading
        system is an unequivocal force for good.<\/p>\n<p>But for the first time in
        decades, the established order of fair, free and open global commerce, which
        has done so much to enrich and empower the world\u2019s nations, is under
        threat.<\/p>\n<p>In April, the World Trade Organization noted that in 2016
        world trade in goods grew by only 1.3% &#8211; the first time since 2001 that
        trade grew more slowly than <abbr title=\"gross domestic product\">GDP<\/abbr>.<\/p>\n<p>This
        threat to growth and prosperity is going largely unrecognised. Countries across
        the world, including the nations of the G7 and the G20, are allowing trade
        restrictive practices to establish themselves, limiting access to these leading
        economies for developed and developing nations alike.<\/p>\n<p>Research by
        the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD<\/abbr>
        that shows that protectionist practices have grown since the financial crisis
        of 2008. By 2010 G7 and G20 countries were estimated to be operating some
        300 non-tariff barriers to trade \u2013 by 2015 this had mushroomed to over
        1,200.<\/p>\n<p>This matters because the silting up of the global trading
        environment has implications beyond mere economics.<\/p>\n<p>For the economic
        prosperity that a liberal trading system generates is a potent force for social
        stability.<\/p>\n<p>That social stability underpins political stability, which
        in turn contributes to our collective security.<\/p>\n<p>Prosperity, stability,
        and security form a continuum where one element cannot be interrupted without
        disrupting the whole.<\/p>\n<p>Geopolitical stability is particularly important
        for countries, like the USA and the UK, with open economies and who hold large
        amounts of investments overseas.<\/p>\n<p>We understand well that instability
        in any part of the global economy, whatever the cause, will ricochet across
        our interdependent, globalised world.<\/p>\n<p>So what is to be done?<\/p>\n<p>Firstly,
        we must lead by example, and work to encourage our trading partners across
        the world to support, and adhere to, the rules-based global trading system.<\/p>\n<p>But
        such a system must ensure that rules are rigorously and effectively policed
        and enforced. Free trade is not a free for all.<\/p>\n<p>Playing by the rules
        means taking firm action against illegal subsidies and dumping.<\/p>\n<p>Trade
        remedy measures can be implemented at relatively short notice, and when used
        proportionally, can level the playing field, ensuring that global trade is
        fair as well as free.<\/p>\n<p>It is worth remembering that these rules are
        not an external imposition on our economies, but were largely shaped and codified
        by the work of successive US and British governments.<\/p>\n<p>In 1948, our
        nations were founding members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.<\/p>\n<p>In
        1986 it was the US, under President Reagan, that launched the Uruguay Round
        of multilateral negotiations that led to the establishment of the World Trade
        Organisation.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the <abbr title=\"World Trade Organization\">WTO<\/abbr>
        continues to be a repository of those values of freedom and fairness in world
        trade.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the system that we established in 1995 may be in
        need of some refurbishment, as I said myself in Geneva last week, but that
        does not mean that we should abandon its principles and processes.<\/p>\n<p>If
        the United States and the United Kingdom are to effectively rise to meet the
        economic challenges of the future, then, like the <abbr title=\"World Trade
        Organization\">WTO<\/abbr>, we too must prepare for the new realities and
        demands of the global economy.<\/p>\n<p>Conceptually, we need to re-evaluate
        some of our traditional institutional frameworks. In the face of the rapidly
        changing global economy, this means a re-assessment of the great 20th century
        structure \u2013 the geographic bloc.<\/p>\n<p>The concept of geographical
        blocs for the purposes of defence still make sense, although greater flexibility
        and wider, more diverse global alliances will be necessary to navigate the
        multiplicity of the security elements of the globalised economy.<\/p>\n<p>For
        trade, however, the case is less clear. The more mature an economy becomes,
        and the more it diversifies into services rather than goods, then this offers
        new opportunities on top of those traditionally available through a geographically
        contiguous trade bloc.<\/p>\n<p>For the most advanced economies like the United
        States, or the UK, where almost 80% of our economic activity is services-based,
        we can afford to seek closer partnerships with those whose demands complement
        our output, not necessarily those who are geographically proximate.<\/p>\n<p>As
        I have often said, if Francis Fukuyama had called his book \u2018the end of
        geography\u2019 not \u2018the end of history\u2019 it would have been much
        closer to describing the world in which we now find ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>I
        am not by any means underplaying the importance of our trade in goods, especially
        for developing markets, but we also need to harness the speed and flexibility
        that the globalised world demands.<\/p>\n<p>This requires the ability to sell
        more into the full range of global markets \u2013 developed and less developed,
        mature and maturing, even if they are further away.<\/p>\n<p>We cannot forget,
        though, that free trade has the capacity to spread wealth to all nations \u2013
        the rising tide of affluence that lifts all boats.<\/p>\n<p>It is incumbent
        upon all developed nations to extend the benefits of free trade to emerging
        economies, and offer them a route to prosperity.<\/p>\n<p>Those who have benefitted
        most from an open, liberal trading environment have a duty to ensure that
        others are able to take advantage of the same benefits in the future.<\/p>\n<p>After
        all, such action is not simply altruistic. It develops the trade partners
        of the future, and allows developed nations to build links to those economies
        that will become the future drivers of global growth.<\/p>\n<p>This principle
        underpins our pursuit of free trade.<\/p>\n<p>If we are to continue to prosper
        in an age where knowledge and services are as economically important as oil,
        or cars, then we must work to build an international framework that keeps
        up with modern demands.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past 70 years much work has been
        done by the United States, Britain, and our partners to abolish tariffs on
        the movement of goods.<\/p>\n<p>All of us here today have witnessed the prosperity
        that this has created. It is time to realise those same benefits for our newest
        and most innovative industries.<\/p>\n<p>Extending trading freedoms to our
        service sector means unlocking new, global markets for our tech companies,
        our finance industry, and the wider knowledge-based economy.<\/p>\n<p>These
        are the areas in which advanced economies can continue to lead the world.
        We should ensure that we give our industries the right conditions to retain
        that competitive edge.<\/p>\n<p>That is why the United Kingdom supports the
        conclusion of the Trade in Services Agreement, or TiSA, as soon as is practicable.<\/p>\n<p>Fundamentally,
        it aims to bestow upon our newest industries those same freedoms that powered
        global growth in the last century.<\/p>\n<p>It is about giving this generation
        the chance to match the success of the last.<\/p>\n<p>I will say again that
        this is not to forget the contribution that manufacturing still brings to
        our respective economies, nor does it seek to duck the challenge of productivity,
        and the opportunities of automation.<\/p>\n<p>It is an acceptance of the economic
        reality of today, and the trading potential that it brings.<\/p>\n<p>We must
        never forget that trade underpins our prosperity. That prosperity underpins
        our security. And that security is the basis of our freedom.<\/p>\n<p>I will
        leave you today with the words of President Reagan:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The
        freer the flow of world trade, the stronger the tides of human progress and

        projects than ever before for the year 2016 to 2017.<\/p>\n<p>With more than
        2,200 projects recorded, the post-referendum figures show an increase of 2%
        on the previous year. The data also shows that 75,226 new jobs were created,
        and 32,672 safeguarded, amounting to over 2,000 jobs per week across the country.<\/p>\n<p>Overall,
        the UK is the number one destination for inward investment in Europe, with
        the technology, renewable energy, life sciences and creative industries all
        seeing an increase in the number of projects.<\/p>\n<p>International Trade
        Secretary, Dr Liam Fox, said:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Almost one year on since
        the EU referendum, the UK continues to attract record levels of inward investment
        and remains extremely attractive to foreign investors.<\/p>\n<p>As an international
        economic department, we continue to promote the strengths of the UK as a great
        inward investment destination, with an open, liberal economy, world-class
        talent and business-friendly taxation.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Overview<\/h2>\n<p>Of
        the record number of projects that the UK attracted, the Department for International
        Trade helped to secure over 80% of them.<\/p>\n<p>The US retains the top spot
        investing in 577 projects in the UK, with China (including Hong Kong) remaining
        in second place with 160 projects. In third place is France with 131 followed
        by last year\u2019s third place India and Australia and New Zealand with 127
        projects each.<\/p>\n<h2>Government support for investment<\/h2>\n<p>As part
        of the government\u2019s drive to attract inward investment, in January this
        year the department launched a major global marketing campaign &#8211; <a
        href=\"https:\/\/invest.great.gov.uk\/int\/\" rel=\"external\">Invest in GREAT
        Britain and Northern Ireland<\/a> &#8211; to promote the UK\u2019s offering
        to international investors.<\/p>\n<p>To date, the campaign has generated 1.4
        million page views of the invest section of the great.gov.uk digital service
        and recorded over 540 prospective investor enquiries. It is already producing
        positive results with Chinese e-commerce company Kuajing.com opening a London
        office and UpCloud, a Finnish cloud hosting company, setting up a UK base
        with plans in place to expand this \u2013 both investment decisions that were
        made after engaging with the campaign.<\/p>\n<h2>Investment across the UK<\/h2>\n<p>Looking
        across the UK, inward investment continues to spread to the regions and devolved
        administrations:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Northern Powerhouse attracted 348 projects,
        creating nearly 15,000 new jobs<\/li>\n<li>the Midlands Engine attracted 223
        projects which resulted in 8,341 new jobs being created<\/li>\n<li>through

        July.<\/p>\n<p>The first meeting of the Trade Working Group, made up of representatives
        from several US and UK government agencies and delegations from the UK and

        Fox champions global free trade"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>I would like to
        begin by thanking <abbr title=\"American Enterprise Institute\">AEI<\/abbr>
        for hosting us today, and for the warm welcome we have had here in the US.<\/p>\n<p>As
        the UK prepares to leave the European Union, Britain enters a new chapter
        in our history.<\/p>\n<p>We will do so as a proud champion in the cause of
        global free trade, unashamedly promoting the importance of the rules-based
        system, and helping to ensure that the proceeds of prosperity are distributed
        to all.<\/p>\n<p>This is a global responsibility, and not one that Britain
        can realise alone.<\/p>\n<p>To achieve our ambition at home, we will seek
        a full and comprehensive trading relationship with our European neighbours,
        retaining the ties of commerce, standards and shared interests that have long
        united us.<\/p>\n<p>Yet we will also set our sights wider, strengthening our
        ties with new friends and old allies alike, as we seek to build a truly global
        Britain.<\/p>\n<p>As far as our own trading relationship with the EU goes,
        we begin from a mutually advantageous position.<\/p>\n<p>Never before have
        2 parties seeking a new trade agreement begun with the advantages of complete
        regulatory equivalence and a zero tariff environment.<\/p>\n<p>Our challenge
        is not primarily economic, but practical and political.<\/p>\n<p>At all stages,
        whether at the <abbr title=\"World Trade Organization\">WTO<\/abbr> in Geneva,
        ensuring the transitional adoption of existing EU agreements into UK law,
        or passing trade legislation through Parliament, we will strive to ensure
        stability, continuity, and no disruption to market access.<\/p>\n<p>And throughout
        this process, our overriding aim is to provide maximum predictability and
        transparency not only to businesses and consumers alike, but to our international
        partners also.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time we must ensure that government works
        together with those in our economy that drive our prosperity.<\/p>\n<p>This
        year marks 2 centuries since David Ricardo introduced his Theory of Comparative
        Advantage.<\/p>\n<p>As everyone here will know, the theory states that, if
        nations are allowed to engage in free and open trade, specialising in the
        export of certain goods and the import of others to meet their needs, then
        there is a mutual increase in economic welfare between nations, making those
        countries richer as a result.<\/p>\n<p>It is one of the most powerful concepts
        in economics, described by the economist Paul Samuelson as the only proposition
        in all the social sciences that is both true and non-trivial and remains,
        to this day, the most fundamental justification of the power of free trade.<\/p>\n<p>Since
        1817, the world has changed beyond all recognition, yet the experiences of
        globalisation, and of technological advances unimaginable in Ricardo\u2019s
        time, have only served to validate his theory.<\/p>\n<p>The principles of
        free and open trade have underpinned the multilateral institutions, rules
        and alliances that helped rebuild post-war Europe and the world beyond.<\/p>\n<p>They
        helped usher the fall of communism and the tearing down of the Iron Curtain;
        they facilitated 70 years of global prosperity, and they have raised the living
        standards of hundreds of millions of people across the world.<\/p>\n<p>Commercial
        liberalism imparts vast economic benefits, but there is also a robust moral
        case for promoting free trade which we must constantly reiterate.<\/p>\n<p>As
        the world\u2019s developing and emerging economies have liberalised their
        trade practices, prosperity has spread across the globe, bringing industry,
        jobs and stability where once there was only poverty.<\/p>\n<p>According to
        the World Bank, the 3 decades between 1981 and 2011 witnessed the single greatest
        decrease in material deprivation in human history \u2013 a truly remarkable
        achievement.<\/p>\n<p>Take India as an example. In 1993, around 45% of India\u2019s
        population sat below the poverty line, as defined by the World Bank. In 2011
        it was 22%.<\/p>\n<p>It is no coincidence that in the intervening period India
        embraced globalisation and started to liberalise its economy.<\/p>\n<p>It
        is hard to imagine an international aid programme, even one as generous as
        our own, that would, or could, have ever been as effective.<\/p>\n<p>It is
        also, sadly, easy to find examples of where a lack of free trade has harmed
        the most vulnerable. If you want to see the contrasting results of open and
        closed economies then look across from China to the Korean peninsula.<\/p>\n<p>In
        1945, both North and South Korea began from a very similar base, but while
        South Korea was eventually more embracing of open trade and free markets,
        Pyongyang turned inwards with the tragic consequences for its citizens that
        we see to this day.<\/p>\n<p>Seoul is now at the heart of a thriving economy
        and dynamic democracy where freedom and prosperity are shared among its people.<\/p>\n<p>It
        should come as no surprise that while over 80% of South Koreans have access
        to the Internet, less than 0.1% of North Koreans enjoy the same. More tragically,
        there is a greater than 10 year discrepancy in the life expectancy of those
        north and south of the demilitarised zone.<\/p>\n<p>Yet for all its humanitarian
        benefits, the value of free trade also lies in its promotion of commercial,
        industrial and economic interests.<\/p>\n<p>As Adam Smith famously observed,
        free trade appeals not to one\u2019s benevolence, but to the idea that prosperity
        is achieved when we are at liberty to pursue our own interests. It just so
        happens that we have many shared interests, ones sought by the UK and US alike.<\/p>\n<p>It
        is perhaps a clich\u00e9 for a British Secretary of State to come to the US
        and talk about the Special Relationship.<\/p>\n<p>Yet the fact that a phrase
        is well-used does not make it any less true.<\/p>\n<p>Britain and America
        are united by language, culture, history, defence and of course commerce and
        trade.<\/p>\n<p>It is perhaps fortuitous that we are also the world\u2019s
        first and fifth largest economies.<\/p>\n<p>The economic value of our bond
        cannot be overstated.<\/p>\n<p>The USA is the UK\u2019s largest export market
        and second largest import market. In 2016 trade between the UK and the USA
        amounted to around $227 billion.<\/p>\n<p>The stock of investment we hold
        in each other\u2019s economies currently stands at $1 trillion. The US is
        the number one destination for UK investment \u2013 thousands of British firms
        have a presence in the US, from car companies to financial services.<\/p>\n<p>US
        companies investing in the UK see a familiar environment, built on economic
        fundamentals which allow businesses to flourish.<\/p>\n<p>They are attracted
        by our low tax and low regulation economy; universities which sit alongside
        their American counterparts in all global top-10 lists; a highly skilled and
        educated workforce; a cutting edge research environment; and the ability to
        operate in the perfect time zone for global trading.<\/p>\n<p>These fundamentals
        will not change; the UK will always be open for business.<\/p>\n<p>In fact,
        the importance of this sentiment is embodied in the fact that one year ago,
        my Department for International Trade was founded to promote Britain\u2019s
        exports abroad, attract inward investment, formulate trade policy, and protect
        our closest trading relationships.<\/p>\n<p>Our task is to build a Britain
        that strengthens our commercial ties with friends and allies across the world,
        utilising Britain\u2019s newly independent trade policy to create new opportunities
        for British businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Yet this will not come at the expense of
        our European partners.<\/p>\n<p>Britain wants the EU to succeed. There will
        be no closing off of relations, economic or otherwise, and no abdication of
        our responsibilities. Continuity and stability will be our watchwords.<\/p>\n<p>But
        any who are tempted to see our exit from the EU as evidence of Britain looking
        inwards should think again. We have just chosen another path \u2013 to embrace
        the wider horizons of a truly global Britain.<\/p>\n<p>As we contemplate our
        new place in the world, we do so with a renewed confidence and optimism, acknowledging
        the vast opportunities that lie before us, especially when it comes to strengthening
        our connection with our single largest trading partner.<\/p>\n<p>My department
        recognises how important our relationship with the USA is.<\/p>\n<p>That is
        why we have established a US-UK Trade and Investment Working Group, dedicated
        to comprehensively strengthening our bilateral relationship.<\/p>\n<p>As a
        priority, the working group will seek to provide stability, certainty and
        confidence for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. Indeed, the first
        discussions will focus on providing commercial continuity as the UK leaves
        the EU.<\/p>\n<p>But our ambitions are much wider. The working group is designed
        to provide a springboard, laying the groundwork for a comprehensive free trade
        agreement between our 2 nations post-Brexit \u2013 the start of a new and
        exciting chapter in our special relationship.<\/p>\n<p>As well as strengthening
        our international relationship, DIT is also working to build upon the tens
        of thousands of local commercial ties that bind our 2 countries.<\/p>\n<p>Tomorrow,
        I will launch a report that details the UK\u2019s trade and investment relationship
        with each of the 435 Congressional Districts within the United States.<\/p>\n<p>The
        report will detail each district\u2019s goods and services trade flows with
        the UK, identify how many jobs are supported by these investments, and detail
        the top UK companies in each district.<\/p>\n<p>For the first time, each member
        of the House of Representatives will have a snapshot of the importance of
        UK trade to their district. Equally, we will be able to see where the opportunities
        lie to strengthen our existing partnerships or forge ahead with new, mutually
        beneficial, ones.<\/p>\n<p>We believe that an open, free, and fair trading
        system is an unequivocal force for good.<\/p>\n<p>But for the first time in
        decades, the established order of fair, free and open global commerce, which
        has done so much to enrich and empower the world\u2019s nations, is under
        threat.<\/p>\n<p>In April, the World Trade Organization noted that in 2016
        world trade in goods grew by only 1.3% &#8211; the first time since 2001 that
        trade grew more slowly than <abbr title=\"gross domestic product\">GDP<\/abbr>.<\/p>\n<p>This
        threat to growth and prosperity is going largely unrecognised. Countries across
        the world, including the nations of the G7 and the G20, are allowing trade
        restrictive practices to establish themselves, limiting access to these leading
        economies for developed and developing nations alike.<\/p>\n<p>Research by
        the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD<\/abbr>
        that shows that protectionist practices have grown since the financial crisis
        of 2008. By 2010 G7 and G20 countries were estimated to be operating some
        300 non-tariff barriers to trade \u2013 by 2015 this had mushroomed to over
        1,200.<\/p>\n<p>This matters because the silting up of the global trading
        environment has implications beyond mere economics.<\/p>\n<p>For the economic
        prosperity that a liberal trading system generates is a potent force for social
        stability.<\/p>\n<p>That social stability underpins political stability, which
        in turn contributes to our collective security.<\/p>\n<p>Prosperity, stability,
        and security form a continuum where one element cannot be interrupted without
        disrupting the whole.<\/p>\n<p>Geopolitical stability is particularly important
        for countries, like the USA and the UK, with open economies and who hold large
        amounts of investments overseas.<\/p>\n<p>We understand well that instability
        in any part of the global economy, whatever the cause, will ricochet across
        our interdependent, globalised world.<\/p>\n<p>So what is to be done?<\/p>\n<p>Firstly,
        we must lead by example, and work to encourage our trading partners across
        the world to support, and adhere to, the rules-based global trading system.<\/p>\n<p>But
        such a system must ensure that rules are rigorously and effectively policed
        and enforced. Free trade is not a free for all.<\/p>\n<p>Playing by the rules
        means taking firm action against illegal subsidies and dumping.<\/p>\n<p>Trade
        remedy measures can be implemented at relatively short notice, and when used
        proportionally, can level the playing field, ensuring that global trade is
        fair as well as free.<\/p>\n<p>It is worth remembering that these rules are
        not an external imposition on our economies, but were largely shaped and codified
        by the work of successive US and British governments.<\/p>\n<p>In 1948, our
        nations were founding members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.<\/p>\n<p>In
        1986 it was the US, under President Reagan, that launched the Uruguay Round
        of multilateral negotiations that led to the establishment of the World Trade
        Organisation.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the <abbr title=\"World Trade Organization\">WTO<\/abbr>
        continues to be a repository of those values of freedom and fairness in world
        trade.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the system that we established in 1995 may be in
        need of some refurbishment, as I said myself in Geneva last week, but that
        does not mean that we should abandon its principles and processes.<\/p>\n<p>If
        the United States and the United Kingdom are to effectively rise to meet the
        economic challenges of the future, then, like the <abbr title=\"World Trade
        Organization\">WTO<\/abbr>, we too must prepare for the new realities and
        demands of the global economy.<\/p>\n<p>Conceptually, we need to re-evaluate
        some of our traditional institutional frameworks. In the face of the rapidly
        changing global economy, this means a re-assessment of the great 20th century
        structure \u2013 the geographic bloc.<\/p>\n<p>The concept of geographical
        blocs for the purposes of defence still make sense, although greater flexibility
        and wider, more diverse global alliances will be necessary to navigate the
        multiplicity of the security elements of the globalised economy.<\/p>\n<p>For
        trade, however, the case is less clear. The more mature an economy becomes,
        and the more it diversifies into services rather than goods, then this offers
        new opportunities on top of those traditionally available through a geographically
        contiguous trade bloc.<\/p>\n<p>For the most advanced economies like the United
        States, or the UK, where almost 80% of our economic activity is services-based,
        we can afford to seek closer partnerships with those whose demands complement
        our output, not necessarily those who are geographically proximate.<\/p>\n<p>As
        I have often said, if Francis Fukuyama had called his book \u2018the end of
        geography\u2019 not \u2018the end of history\u2019 it would have been much
        closer to describing the world in which we now find ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>I
        am not by any means underplaying the importance of our trade in goods, especially
        for developing markets, but we also need to harness the speed and flexibility
        that the globalised world demands.<\/p>\n<p>This requires the ability to sell
        more into the full range of global markets \u2013 developed and less developed,
        mature and maturing, even if they are further away.<\/p>\n<p>We cannot forget,
        though, that free trade has the capacity to spread wealth to all nations \u2013
        the rising tide of affluence that lifts all boats.<\/p>\n<p>It is incumbent
        upon all developed nations to extend the benefits of free trade to emerging
        economies, and offer them a route to prosperity.<\/p>\n<p>Those who have benefitted
        most from an open, liberal trading environment have a duty to ensure that
        others are able to take advantage of the same benefits in the future.<\/p>\n<p>After
        all, such action is not simply altruistic. It develops the trade partners
        of the future, and allows developed nations to build links to those economies
        that will become the future drivers of global growth.<\/p>\n<p>This principle
        underpins our pursuit of free trade.<\/p>\n<p>If we are to continue to prosper
        in an age where knowledge and services are as economically important as oil,
        or cars, then we must work to build an international framework that keeps
        up with modern demands.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past 70 years much work has been
        done by the United States, Britain, and our partners to abolish tariffs on
        the movement of goods.<\/p>\n<p>All of us here today have witnessed the prosperity
        that this has created. It is time to realise those same benefits for our newest
        and most innovative industries.<\/p>\n<p>Extending trading freedoms to our
        service sector means unlocking new, global markets for our tech companies,
        our finance industry, and the wider knowledge-based economy.<\/p>\n<p>These
        are the areas in which advanced economies can continue to lead the world.
        We should ensure that we give our industries the right conditions to retain
        that competitive edge.<\/p>\n<p>That is why the United Kingdom supports the
        conclusion of the Trade in Services Agreement, or TiSA, as soon as is practicable.<\/p>\n<p>Fundamentally,
        it aims to bestow upon our newest industries those same freedoms that powered
        global growth in the last century.<\/p>\n<p>It is about giving this generation
        the chance to match the success of the last.<\/p>\n<p>I will say again that
        this is not to forget the contribution that manufacturing still brings to
        our respective economies, nor does it seek to duck the challenge of productivity,
        and the opportunities of automation.<\/p>\n<p>It is an acceptance of the economic
        reality of today, and the trading potential that it brings.<\/p>\n<p>We must
        never forget that trade underpins our prosperity. That prosperity underpins
        our security. And that security is the basis of our freedom.<\/p>\n<p>I will
        leave you today with the words of President Reagan:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The
        freer the flow of world trade, the stronger the tides of human progress and
        peace among nations.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>There is no greater prize than

        Fox champions global free trade"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>I would like to
        begin by thanking <abbr title=\"American Enterprise Institute\">AEI<\/abbr>
        for hosting us today, and for the warm welcome we have had here in the US.<\/p>\n<p>As
        the UK prepares to leave the European Union, Britain enters a new chapter
        in our history.<\/p>\n<p>We will do so as a proud champion in the cause of
        global free trade, unashamedly promoting the importance of the rules-based
        system, and helping to ensure that the proceeds of prosperity are distributed
        to all.<\/p>\n<p>This is a global responsibility, and not one that Britain
        can realise alone.<\/p>\n<p>To achieve our ambition at home, we will seek
        a full and comprehensive trading relationship with our European neighbours,
        retaining the ties of commerce, standards and shared interests that have long
        united us.<\/p>\n<p>Yet we will also set our sights wider, strengthening our
        ties with new friends and old allies alike, as we seek to build a truly global
        Britain.<\/p>\n<p>As far as our own trading relationship with the EU goes,
        we begin from a mutually advantageous position.<\/p>\n<p>Never before have
        2 parties seeking a new trade agreement begun with the advantages of complete
        regulatory equivalence and a zero tariff environment.<\/p>\n<p>Our challenge
        is not primarily economic, but practical and political.<\/p>\n<p>At all stages,
        whether at the <abbr title=\"World Trade Organization\">WTO<\/abbr> in Geneva,
        ensuring the transitional adoption of existing EU agreements into UK law,
        or passing trade legislation through Parliament, we will strive to ensure
        stability, continuity, and no disruption to market access.<\/p>\n<p>And throughout
        this process, our overriding aim is to provide maximum predictability and
        transparency not only to businesses and consumers alike, but to our international
        partners also.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time we must ensure that government works
        together with those in our economy that drive our prosperity.<\/p>\n<p>This
        year marks 2 centuries since David Ricardo introduced his Theory of Comparative
        Advantage.<\/p>\n<p>As everyone here will know, the theory states that, if
        nations are allowed to engage in free and open trade, specialising in the
        export of certain goods and the import of others to meet their needs, then
        there is a mutual increase in economic welfare between nations, making those
        countries richer as a result.<\/p>\n<p>It is one of the most powerful concepts
        in economics, described by the economist Paul Samuelson as the only proposition
        in all the social sciences that is both true and non-trivial and remains,
        to this day, the most fundamental justification of the power of free trade.<\/p>\n<p>Since
        1817, the world has changed beyond all recognition, yet the experiences of
        globalisation, and of technological advances unimaginable in Ricardo\u2019s
        time, have only served to validate his theory.<\/p>\n<p>The principles of
        free and open trade have underpinned the multilateral institutions, rules
        and alliances that helped rebuild post-war Europe and the world beyond.<\/p>\n<p>They
        helped usher the fall of communism and the tearing down of the Iron Curtain;
        they facilitated 70 years of global prosperity, and they have raised the living
        standards of hundreds of millions of people across the world.<\/p>\n<p>Commercial
        liberalism imparts vast economic benefits, but there is also a robust moral
        case for promoting free trade which we must constantly reiterate.<\/p>\n<p>As
        the world\u2019s developing and emerging economies have liberalised their
        trade practices, prosperity has spread across the globe, bringing industry,
        jobs and stability where once there was only poverty.<\/p>\n<p>According to
        the World Bank, the 3 decades between 1981 and 2011 witnessed the single greatest
        decrease in material deprivation in human history \u2013 a truly remarkable
        achievement.<\/p>\n<p>Take India as an example. In 1993, around 45% of India\u2019s
        population sat below the poverty line, as defined by the World Bank. In 2011
        it was 22%.<\/p>\n<p>It is no coincidence that in the intervening period India
        embraced globalisation and started to liberalise its economy.<\/p>\n<p>It
        is hard to imagine an international aid programme, even one as generous as
        our own, that would, or could, have ever been as effective.<\/p>\n<p>It is
        also, sadly, easy to find examples of where a lack of free trade has harmed
        the most vulnerable. If you want to see the contrasting results of open and
        closed economies then look across from China to the Korean peninsula.<\/p>\n<p>In
        1945, both North and South Korea began from a very similar base, but while
        South Korea was eventually more embracing of open trade and free markets,
        Pyongyang turned inwards with the tragic consequences for its citizens that
        we see to this day.<\/p>\n<p>Seoul is now at the heart of a thriving economy
        and dynamic democracy where freedom and prosperity are shared among its people.<\/p>\n<p>It
        should come as no surprise that while over 80% of South Koreans have access
        to the Internet, less than 0.1% of North Koreans enjoy the same. More tragically,
        there is a greater than 10 year discrepancy in the life expectancy of those
        north and south of the demilitarised zone.<\/p>\n<p>Yet for all its humanitarian
        benefits, the value of free trade also lies in its promotion of commercial,
        industrial and economic interests.<\/p>\n<p>As Adam Smith famously observed,
        free trade appeals not to one\u2019s benevolence, but to the idea that prosperity
        is achieved when we are at liberty to pursue our own interests. It just so
        happens that we have many shared interests, ones sought by the UK and US alike.<\/p>\n<p>It
        is perhaps a clich\u00e9 for a British Secretary of State to come to the US
        and talk about the Special Relationship.<\/p>\n<p>Yet the fact that a phrase
        is well-used does not make it any less true.<\/p>\n<p>Britain and America
        are united by language, culture, history, defence and of course commerce and
        trade.<\/p>\n<p>It is perhaps fortuitous that we are also the world\u2019s
        first and fifth largest economies.<\/p>\n<p>The economic value of our bond
        cannot be overstated.<\/p>\n<p>The USA is the UK\u2019s largest export market
        and second largest import market. In 2016 trade between the UK and the USA
        amounted to around $227 billion.<\/p>\n<p>The stock of investment we hold
        in each other\u2019s economies currently stands at $1 trillion. The US is
        the number one destination for UK investment \u2013 thousands of British firms
        have a presence in the US, from car companies to financial services.<\/p>\n<p>US
        companies investing in the UK see a familiar environment, built on economic
        fundamentals which allow businesses to flourish.<\/p>\n<p>They are attracted
        by our low tax and low regulation economy; universities which sit alongside
        their American counterparts in all global top-10 lists; a highly skilled and
        educated workforce; a cutting edge research environment; and the ability to
        operate in the perfect time zone for global trading.<\/p>\n<p>These fundamentals
        will not change; the UK will always be open for business.<\/p>\n<p>In fact,
        the importance of this sentiment is embodied in the fact that one year ago,
        my Department for International Trade was founded to promote Britain\u2019s
        exports abroad, attract inward investment, formulate trade policy, and protect
        our closest trading relationships.<\/p>\n<p>Our task is to build a Britain
        that strengthens our commercial ties with friends and allies across the world,
        utilising Britain\u2019s newly independent trade policy to create new opportunities
        for British businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Yet this will not come at the expense of
        our European partners.<\/p>\n<p>Britain wants the EU to succeed. There will
        be no closing off of relations, economic or otherwise, and no abdication of
        our responsibilities. Continuity and stability will be our watchwords.<\/p>\n<p>But
        any who are tempted to see our exit from the EU as evidence of Britain looking
        inwards should think again. We have just chosen another path \u2013 to embrace
        the wider horizons of a truly global Britain.<\/p>\n<p>As we contemplate our
        new place in the world, we do so with a renewed confidence and optimism, acknowledging
        the vast opportunities that lie before us, especially when it comes to strengthening
        our connection with our single largest trading partner.<\/p>\n<p>My department
        recognises how important our relationship with the USA is.<\/p>\n<p>That is
        why we have established a US-UK Trade and Investment Working Group, dedicated
        to comprehensively strengthening our bilateral relationship.<\/p>\n<p>As a
        priority, the working group will seek to provide stability, certainty and
        confidence for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. Indeed, the first
        discussions will focus on providing commercial continuity as the UK leaves
        the EU.<\/p>\n<p>But our ambitions are much wider. The working group is designed
        to provide a springboard, laying the groundwork for a comprehensive free trade
        agreement between our 2 nations post-Brexit \u2013 the start of a new and
        exciting chapter in our special relationship.<\/p>\n<p>As well as strengthening
        our international relationship, DIT is also working to build upon the tens
        of thousands of local commercial ties that bind our 2 countries.<\/p>\n<p>Tomorrow,
        I will launch a report that details the UK\u2019s trade and investment relationship
        with each of the 435 Congressional Districts within the United States.<\/p>\n<p>The
        report will detail each district\u2019s goods and services trade flows with
        the UK, identify how many jobs are supported by these investments, and detail
        the top UK companies in each district.<\/p>\n<p>For the first time, each member
        of the House of Representatives will have a snapshot of the importance of
        UK trade to their district. Equally, we will be able to see where the opportunities
        lie to strengthen our existing partnerships or forge ahead with new, mutually
        beneficial, ones.<\/p>\n<p>We believe that an open, free, and fair trading
        system is an unequivocal force for good.<\/p>\n<p>But for the first time in
        decades, the established order of fair, free and open global commerce, which
        has done so much to enrich and empower the world\u2019s nations, is under
        threat.<\/p>\n<p>In April, the World Trade Organization noted that in 2016
        world trade in goods grew by only 1.3% &#8211; the first time since 2001 that
        trade grew more slowly than <abbr title=\"gross domestic product\">GDP<\/abbr>.<\/p>\n<p>This
        threat to growth and prosperity is going largely unrecognised. Countries across
        the world, including the nations of the G7 and the G20, are allowing trade
        restrictive practices to establish themselves, limiting access to these leading
        economies for developed and developing nations alike.<\/p>\n<p>Research by
        the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD<\/abbr>
        that shows that protectionist practices have grown since the financial crisis
        of 2008. By 2010 G7 and G20 countries were estimated to be operating some
        300 non-tariff barriers to trade \u2013 by 2015 this had mushroomed to over
        1,200.<\/p>\n<p>This matters because the silting up of the global trading
        environment has implications beyond mere economics.<\/p>\n<p>For the economic
        prosperity that a liberal trading system generates is a potent force for social
        stability.<\/p>\n<p>That social stability underpins political stability, which
        in turn contributes to our collective security.<\/p>\n<p>Prosperity, stability,
        and security form a continuum where one element cannot be interrupted without
        disrupting the whole.<\/p>\n<p>Geopolitical stability is particularly important
        for countries, like the USA and the UK, with open economies and who hold large
        amounts of investments overseas.<\/p>\n<p>We understand well that instability
        in any part of the global economy, whatever the cause, will ricochet across
        our interdependent, globalised world.<\/p>\n<p>So what is to be done?<\/p>\n<p>Firstly,
        we must lead by example, and work to encourage our trading partners across
        the world to support, and adhere to, the rules-based global trading system.<\/p>\n<p>But
        such a system must ensure that rules are rigorously and effectively policed
        and enforced. Free trade is not a free for all.<\/p>\n<p>Playing by the rules
        means taking firm action against illegal subsidies and dumping.<\/p>\n<p>Trade
        remedy measures can be implemented at relatively short notice, and when used
        proportionally, can level the playing field, ensuring that global trade is
        fair as well as free.<\/p>\n<p>It is worth remembering that these rules are
        not an external imposition on our economies, but were largely shaped and codified
        by the work of successive US and British governments.<\/p>\n<p>In 1948, our
        nations were founding members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.<\/p>\n<p>In
        1986 it was the US, under President Reagan, that launched the Uruguay Round
        of multilateral negotiations that led to the establishment of the World Trade
        Organisation.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the <abbr title=\"World Trade Organization\">WTO<\/abbr>
        continues to be a repository of those values of freedom and fairness in world
        trade.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the system that we established in 1995 may be in
        need of some refurbishment, as I said myself in Geneva last week, but that
        does not mean that we should abandon its principles and processes.<\/p>\n<p>If
        the United States and the United Kingdom are to effectively rise to meet the
        economic challenges of the future, then, like the <abbr title=\"World Trade
        Organization\">WTO<\/abbr>, we too must prepare for the new realities and
        demands of the global economy.<\/p>\n<p>Conceptually, we need to re-evaluate
        some of our traditional institutional frameworks. In the face of the rapidly
        changing global economy, this means a re-assessment of the great 20th century
        structure \u2013 the geographic bloc.<\/p>\n<p>The concept of geographical
        blocs for the purposes of defence still make sense, although greater flexibility
        and wider, more diverse global alliances will be necessary to navigate the
        multiplicity of the security elements of the globalised economy.<\/p>\n<p>For
        trade, however, the case is less clear. The more mature an economy becomes,
        and the more it diversifies into services rather than goods, then this offers
        new opportunities on top of those traditionally available through a geographically
        contiguous trade bloc.<\/p>\n<p>For the most advanced economies like the United
        States, or the UK, where almost 80% of our economic activity is services-based,
        we can afford to seek closer partnerships with those whose demands complement
        our output, not necessarily those who are geographically proximate.<\/p>\n<p>As
        I have often said, if Francis Fukuyama had called his book \u2018the end of
        geography\u2019 not \u2018the end of history\u2019 it would have been much
        closer to describing the world in which we now find ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>I
        am not by any means underplaying the importance of our trade in goods, especially
        for developing markets, but we also need to harness the speed and flexibility
        that the globalised world demands.<\/p>\n<p>This requires the ability to sell
        more into the full range of global markets \u2013 developed and less developed,
        mature and maturing, even if they are further away.<\/p>\n<p>We cannot forget,
        though, that free trade has the capacity to spread wealth to all nations \u2013
        the rising tide of affluence that lifts all boats.<\/p>\n<p>It is incumbent
        upon all developed nations to extend the benefits of free trade to emerging
        economies, and offer them a route to prosperity.<\/p>\n<p>Those who have benefitted
        most from an open, liberal trading environment have a duty to ensure that
        others are able to take advantage of the same benefits in the future.<\/p>\n<p>After
        all, such action is not simply altruistic. It develops the trade partners
        of the future, and allows developed nations to build links to those economies
        that will become the future drivers of global growth.<\/p>\n<p>This principle
        underpins our pursuit of free trade.<\/p>\n<p>If we are to continue to prosper
        in an age where knowledge and services are as economically important as oil,
        or cars, then we must work to build an international framework that keeps
        up with modern demands.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past 70 years much work has been
        done by the United States, Britain, and our partners to abolish tariffs on
        the movement of goods.<\/p>\n<p>All of us here today have witnessed the prosperity
        that this has created. It is time to realise those same benefits for our newest
        and most innovative industries.<\/p>\n<p>Extending trading freedoms to our
        service sector means unlocking new, global markets for our tech companies,
        our finance industry, and the wider knowledge-based economy.<\/p>\n<p>These
        are the areas in which advanced economies can continue to lead the world.
        We should ensure that we give our industries the right conditions to retain
        that competitive edge.<\/p>\n<p>That is why the United Kingdom supports the
        conclusion of the Trade in Services Agreement, or TiSA, as soon as is practicable.<\/p>\n<p>Fundamentally,
        it aims to bestow upon our newest industries those same freedoms that powered
        global growth in the last century.<\/p>\n<p>It is about giving this generation
        the chance to match the success of the last.<\/p>\n<p>I will say again that
        this is not to forget the contribution that manufacturing still brings to
        our respective economies, nor does it seek to duck the challenge of productivity,
        and the opportunities of automation.<\/p>\n<p>It is an acceptance of the economic
        reality of today, and the trading potential that it brings.<\/p>\n<p>We must
        never forget that trade underpins our prosperity. That prosperity underpins
        our security. And that security is the basis of our freedom.<\/p>\n<p>I will
        leave you today with the words of President Reagan:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The
        freer the flow of world trade, the stronger the tides of human progress and

        on the previous year. The data also shows that 75,226 new jobs were created,
        and 32,672 safeguarded, amounting to over 2,000 jobs per week across the country.<\/p>\n<p>Overall,
        the UK is the number one destination for inward investment in Europe, with
        the technology, renewable energy, life sciences and creative industries all
        seeing an increase in the number of projects.<\/p>\n<p>International Trade
        Secretary, Dr Liam Fox, said:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Almost one year on since
        the EU referendum, the UK continues to attract record levels of inward investment
        and remains extremely attractive to foreign investors.<\/p>\n<p>As an international
        economic department, we continue to promote the strengths of the UK as a great
        inward investment destination, with an open, liberal economy, world-class
        talent and business-friendly taxation.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>Overview<\/h2>\n<p>Of
        the record number of projects that the UK attracted, the Department for International
        Trade helped to secure over 80% of them.<\/p>\n<p>The US retains the top spot
        investing in 577 projects in the UK, with China (including Hong Kong) remaining
        in second place with 160 projects. In third place is France with 131 followed
        by last year\u2019s third place India and Australia and New Zealand with 127
        projects each.<\/p>\n<h2>Government support for investment<\/h2>\n<p>As part
        of the government\u2019s drive to attract inward investment, in January this
        year the department launched a major global marketing campaign &#8211; <a
        href=\"https:\/\/invest.great.gov.uk\/int\/\" rel=\"external\">Invest in GREAT
        Britain and Northern Ireland<\/a> &#8211; to promote the UK\u2019s offering
        to international investors.<\/p>\n<p>To date, the campaign has generated 1.4
        million page views of the invest section of the great.gov.uk digital service
        and recorded over 540 prospective investor enquiries. It is already producing
        positive results with Chinese e-commerce company Kuajing.com opening a London
        office and UpCloud, a Finnish cloud hosting company, setting up a UK base
        with plans in place to expand this \u2013 both investment decisions that were
        made after engaging with the campaign.<\/p>\n<h2>Investment across the UK<\/h2>\n<p>Looking
        across the UK, inward investment continues to spread to the regions and devolved
        administrations:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>the Northern Powerhouse attracted 348 projects,
        creating nearly 15,000 new jobs<\/li>\n<li>the Midlands Engine attracted 223
        projects which resulted in 8,341 new jobs being created<\/li>\n<li>through

        Fox champions global free trade"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>I would like to
        begin by thanking <abbr title=\"American Enterprise Institute\">AEI<\/abbr>
        for hosting us today, and for the warm welcome we have had here in the US.<\/p>\n<p>As
        the UK prepares to leave the European Union, Britain enters a new chapter
        in our history.<\/p>\n<p>We will do so as a proud champion in the cause of
        global free trade, unashamedly promoting the importance of the rules-based
        system, and helping to ensure that the proceeds of prosperity are distributed
        to all.<\/p>\n<p>This is a global responsibility, and not one that Britain
        can realise alone.<\/p>\n<p>To achieve our ambition at home, we will seek
        a full and comprehensive trading relationship with our European neighbours,
        retaining the ties of commerce, standards and shared interests that have long
        united us.<\/p>\n<p>Yet we will also set our sights wider, strengthening our
        ties with new friends and old allies alike, as we seek to build a truly global
        Britain.<\/p>\n<p>As far as our own trading relationship with the EU goes,
        we begin from a mutually advantageous position.<\/p>\n<p>Never before have
        2 parties seeking a new trade agreement begun with the advantages of complete
        regulatory equivalence and a zero tariff environment.<\/p>\n<p>Our challenge
        is not primarily economic, but practical and political.<\/p>\n<p>At all stages,
        whether at the <abbr title=\"World Trade Organization\">WTO<\/abbr> in Geneva,
        ensuring the transitional adoption of existing EU agreements into UK law,
        or passing trade legislation through Parliament, we will strive to ensure
        stability, continuity, and no disruption to market access.<\/p>\n<p>And throughout
        this process, our overriding aim is to provide maximum predictability and
        transparency not only to businesses and consumers alike, but to our international
        partners also.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time we must ensure that government works
        together with those in our economy that drive our prosperity.<\/p>\n<p>This
        year marks 2 centuries since David Ricardo introduced his Theory of Comparative
        Advantage.<\/p>\n<p>As everyone here will know, the theory states that, if
        nations are allowed to engage in free and open trade, specialising in the
        export of certain goods and the import of others to meet their needs, then
        there is a mutual increase in economic welfare between nations, making those
        countries richer as a result.<\/p>\n<p>It is one of the most powerful concepts
        in economics, described by the economist Paul Samuelson as the only proposition
        in all the social sciences that is both true and non-trivial and remains,
        to this day, the most fundamental justification of the power of free trade.<\/p>\n<p>Since
        1817, the world has changed beyond all recognition, yet the experiences of
        globalisation, and of technological advances unimaginable in Ricardo\u2019s
        time, have only served to validate his theory.<\/p>\n<p>The principles of
        free and open trade have underpinned the multilateral institutions, rules
        and alliances that helped rebuild post-war Europe and the world beyond.<\/p>\n<p>They
        helped usher the fall of communism and the tearing down of the Iron Curtain;
        they facilitated 70 years of global prosperity, and they have raised the living
        standards of hundreds of millions of people across the world.<\/p>\n<p>Commercial
        liberalism imparts vast economic benefits, but there is also a robust moral
        case for promoting free trade which we must constantly reiterate.<\/p>\n<p>As
        the world\u2019s developing and emerging economies have liberalised their
        trade practices, prosperity has spread across the globe, bringing industry,
        jobs and stability where once there was only poverty.<\/p>\n<p>According to
        the World Bank, the 3 decades between 1981 and 2011 witnessed the single greatest
        decrease in material deprivation in human history \u2013 a truly remarkable
        achievement.<\/p>\n<p>Take India as an example. In 1993, around 45% of India\u2019s
        population sat below the poverty line, as defined by the World Bank. In 2011
        it was 22%.<\/p>\n<p>It is no coincidence that in the intervening period India
        embraced globalisation and started to liberalise its economy.<\/p>\n<p>It
        is hard to imagine an international aid programme, even one as generous as
        our own, that would, or could, have ever been as effective.<\/p>\n<p>It is
        also, sadly, easy to find examples of where a lack of free trade has harmed
        the most vulnerable. If you want to see the contrasting results of open and
        closed economies then look across from China to the Korean peninsula.<\/p>\n<p>In
        1945, both North and South Korea began from a very similar base, but while
        South Korea was eventually more embracing of open trade and free markets,
        Pyongyang turned inwards with the tragic consequences for its citizens that
        we see to this day.<\/p>\n<p>Seoul is now at the heart of a thriving economy
        and dynamic democracy where freedom and prosperity are shared among its people.<\/p>\n<p>It
        should come as no surprise that while over 80% of South Koreans have access
        to the Internet, less than 0.1% of North Koreans enjoy the same. More tragically,
        there is a greater than 10 year discrepancy in the life expectancy of those
        north and south of the demilitarised zone.<\/p>\n<p>Yet for all its humanitarian
        benefits, the value of free trade also lies in its promotion of commercial,
        industrial and economic interests.<\/p>\n<p>As Adam Smith famously observed,
        free trade appeals not to one\u2019s benevolence, but to the idea that prosperity
        is achieved when we are at liberty to pursue our own interests. It just so
        happens that we have many shared interests, ones sought by the UK and US alike.<\/p>\n<p>It
        is perhaps a clich\u00e9 for a British Secretary of State to come to the US
        and talk about the Special Relationship.<\/p>\n<p>Yet the fact that a phrase
        is well-used does not make it any less true.<\/p>\n<p>Britain and America
        are united by language, culture, history, defence and of course commerce and
        trade.<\/p>\n<p>It is perhaps fortuitous that we are also the world\u2019s
        first and fifth largest economies.<\/p>\n<p>The economic value of our bond
        cannot be overstated.<\/p>\n<p>The USA is the UK\u2019s largest export market
        and second largest import market. In 2016 trade between the UK and the USA
        amounted to around $227 billion.<\/p>\n<p>The stock of investment we hold
        in each other\u2019s economies currently stands at $1 trillion. The US is
        the number one destination for UK investment \u2013 thousands of British firms
        have a presence in the US, from car companies to financial services.<\/p>\n<p>US
        companies investing in the UK see a familiar environment, built on economic
        fundamentals which allow businesses to flourish.<\/p>\n<p>They are attracted
        by our low tax and low regulation economy; universities which sit alongside
        their American counterparts in all global top-10 lists; a highly skilled and
        educated workforce; a cutting edge research environment; and the ability to
        operate in the perfect time zone for global trading.<\/p>\n<p>These fundamentals
        will not change; the UK will always be open for business.<\/p>\n<p>In fact,
        the importance of this sentiment is embodied in the fact that one year ago,
        my Department for International Trade was founded to promote Britain\u2019s
        exports abroad, attract inward investment, formulate trade policy, and protect
        our closest trading relationships.<\/p>\n<p>Our task is to build a Britain
        that strengthens our commercial ties with friends and allies across the world,
        utilising Britain\u2019s newly independent trade policy to create new opportunities
        for British businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Yet this will not come at the expense of
        our European partners.<\/p>\n<p>Britain wants the EU to succeed. There will
        be no closing off of relations, economic or otherwise, and no abdication of
        our responsibilities. Continuity and stability will be our watchwords.<\/p>\n<p>But
        any who are tempted to see our exit from the EU as evidence of Britain looking
        inwards should think again. We have just chosen another path \u2013 to embrace
        the wider horizons of a truly global Britain.<\/p>\n<p>As we contemplate our
        new place in the world, we do so with a renewed confidence and optimism, acknowledging
        the vast opportunities that lie before us, especially when it comes to strengthening
        our connection with our single largest trading partner.<\/p>\n<p>My department
        recognises how important our relationship with the USA is.<\/p>\n<p>That is
        why we have established a US-UK Trade and Investment Working Group, dedicated
        to comprehensively strengthening our bilateral relationship.<\/p>\n<p>As a
        priority, the working group will seek to provide stability, certainty and
        confidence for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. Indeed, the first
        discussions will focus on providing commercial continuity as the UK leaves
        the EU.<\/p>\n<p>But our ambitions are much wider. The working group is designed
        to provide a springboard, laying the groundwork for a comprehensive free trade
        agreement between our 2 nations post-Brexit \u2013 the start of a new and
        exciting chapter in our special relationship.<\/p>\n<p>As well as strengthening
        our international relationship, DIT is also working to build upon the tens
        of thousands of local commercial ties that bind our 2 countries.<\/p>\n<p>Tomorrow,
        I will launch a report that details the UK\u2019s trade and investment relationship
        with each of the 435 Congressional Districts within the United States.<\/p>\n<p>The
        report will detail each district\u2019s goods and services trade flows with
        the UK, identify how many jobs are supported by these investments, and detail
        the top UK companies in each district.<\/p>\n<p>For the first time, each member
        of the House of Representatives will have a snapshot of the importance of
        UK trade to their district. Equally, we will be able to see where the opportunities
        lie to strengthen our existing partnerships or forge ahead with new, mutually
        beneficial, ones.<\/p>\n<p>We believe that an open, free, and fair trading
        system is an unequivocal force for good.<\/p>\n<p>But for the first time in
        decades, the established order of fair, free and open global commerce, which
        has done so much to enrich and empower the world\u2019s nations, is under
        threat.<\/p>\n<p>In April, the World Trade Organization noted that in 2016
        world trade in goods grew by only 1.3% &#8211; the first time since 2001 that
        trade grew more slowly than <abbr title=\"gross domestic product\">GDP<\/abbr>.<\/p>\n<p>This
        threat to growth and prosperity is going largely unrecognised. Countries across
        the world, including the nations of the G7 and the G20, are allowing trade
        restrictive practices to establish themselves, limiting access to these leading
        economies for developed and developing nations alike.<\/p>\n<p>Research by
        the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD<\/abbr>
        that shows that protectionist practices have grown since the financial crisis
        of 2008. By 2010 G7 and G20 countries were estimated to be operating some
        300 non-tariff barriers to trade \u2013 by 2015 this had mushroomed to over
        1,200.<\/p>\n<p>This matters because the silting up of the global trading
        environment has implications beyond mere economics.<\/p>\n<p>For the economic
        prosperity that a liberal trading system generates is a potent force for social
        stability.<\/p>\n<p>That social stability underpins political stability, which
        in turn contributes to our collective security.<\/p>\n<p>Prosperity, stability,
        and security form a continuum where one element cannot be interrupted without
        disrupting the whole.<\/p>\n<p>Geopolitical stability is particularly important
        for countries, like the USA and the UK, with open economies and who hold large
        amounts of investments overseas.<\/p>\n<p>We understand well that instability
        in any part of the global economy, whatever the cause, will ricochet across
        our interdependent, globalised world.<\/p>\n<p>So what is to be done?<\/p>\n<p>Firstly,
        we must lead by example, and work to encourage our trading partners across
        the world to support, and adhere to, the rules-based global trading system.<\/p>\n<p>But
        such a system must ensure that rules are rigorously and effectively policed
        and enforced. Free trade is not a free for all.<\/p>\n<p>Playing by the rules
        means taking firm action against illegal subsidies and dumping.<\/p>\n<p>Trade
        remedy measures can be implemented at relatively short notice, and when used
        proportionally, can level the playing field, ensuring that global trade is
        fair as well as free.<\/p>\n<p>It is worth remembering that these rules are
        not an external imposition on our economies, but were largely shaped and codified
        by the work of successive US and British governments.<\/p>\n<p>In 1948, our
        nations were founding members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.<\/p>\n<p>In
        1986 it was the US, under President Reagan, that launched the Uruguay Round
        of multilateral negotiations that led to the establishment of the World Trade
        Organisation.<\/p>\n<p>Today, the <abbr title=\"World Trade Organization\">WTO<\/abbr>
        continues to be a repository of those values of freedom and fairness in world
        trade.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the system that we established in 1995 may be in
        need of some refurbishment, as I said myself in Geneva last week, but that
        does not mean that we should abandon its principles and processes.<\/p>\n<p>If
        the United States and the United Kingdom are to effectively rise to meet the
        economic challenges of the future, then, like the <abbr title=\"World Trade
        Organization\">WTO<\/abbr>, we too must prepare for the new realities and
        demands of the global economy.<\/p>\n<p>Conceptually, we need to re-evaluate
        some of our traditional institutional frameworks. In the face of the rapidly
        changing global economy, this means a re-assessment of the great 20th century
        structure \u2013 the geographic bloc.<\/p>\n<p>The concept of geographical
        blocs for the purposes of defence still make sense, although greater flexibility
        and wider, more diverse global alliances will be necessary to navigate the
        multiplicity of the security elements of the globalised economy.<\/p>\n<p>For
        trade, however, the case is less clear. The more mature an economy becomes,
        and the more it diversifies into services rather than goods, then this offers
        new opportunities on top of those traditionally available through a geographically
        contiguous trade bloc.<\/p>\n<p>For the most advanced economies like the United
        States, or the UK, where almost 80% of our economic activity is services-based,
        we can afford to seek closer partnerships with those whose demands complement
        our output, not necessarily those who are geographically proximate.<\/p>\n<p>As
        I have often said, if Francis Fukuyama had called his book \u2018the end of
        geography\u2019 not \u2018the end of history\u2019 it would have been much
        closer to describing the world in which we now find ourselves.<\/p>\n<p>I
        am not by any means underplaying the importance of our trade in goods, especially
        for developing markets, but we also need to harness the speed and flexibility
        that the globalised world demands.<\/p>\n<p>This requires the ability to sell
        more into the full range of global markets \u2013 developed and less developed,
        mature and maturing, even if they are further away.<\/p>\n<p>We cannot forget,
        though, that free trade has the capacity to spread wealth to all nations \u2013
        the rising tide of affluence that lifts all boats.<\/p>\n<p>It is incumbent
        upon all developed nations to extend the benefits of free trade to emerging
        economies, and offer them a route to prosperity.<\/p>\n<p>Those who have benefitted
        most from an open, liberal trading environment have a duty to ensure that
        others are able to take advantage of the same benefits in the future.<\/p>\n<p>After
        all, such action is not simply altruistic. It develops the trade partners
        of the future, and allows developed nations to build links to those economies
        that will become the future drivers of global growth.<\/p>\n<p>This principle
        underpins our pursuit of free trade.<\/p>\n<p>If we are to continue to prosper
        in an age where knowledge and services are as economically important as oil,
        or cars, then we must work to build an international framework that keeps
        up with modern demands.<\/p>\n<p>Over the past 70 years much work has been
        done by the United States, Britain, and our partners to abolish tariffs on
        the movement of goods.<\/p>\n<p>All of us here today have witnessed the prosperity
        that this has created. It is time to realise those same benefits for our newest
        and most innovative industries.<\/p>\n<p>Extending trading freedoms to our
        service sector means unlocking new, global markets for our tech companies,
        our finance industry, and the wider knowledge-based economy.<\/p>\n<p>These
        are the areas in which advanced economies can continue to lead the world.
        We should ensure that we give our industries the right conditions to retain
        that competitive edge.<\/p>\n<p>That is why the United Kingdom supports the
        conclusion of the Trade in Services Agreement, or TiSA, as soon as is practicable.<\/p>\n<p>Fundamentally,
        it aims to bestow upon our newest industries those same freedoms that powered
        global growth in the last century.<\/p>\n<p>It is about giving this generation
        the chance to match the success of the last.<\/p>\n<p>I will say again that
        this is not to forget the contribution that manufacturing still brings to
        our respective economies, nor does it seek to duck the challenge of productivity,
        and the opportunities of automation.<\/p>\n<p>It is an acceptance of the economic
        reality of today, and the trading potential that it brings.<\/p>\n<p>We must
        never forget that trade underpins our prosperity. That prosperity underpins
        our security. And that security is the basis of our freedom.<\/p>\n<p>I will
        leave you today with the words of President Reagan:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The
        freer the flow of world trade, the stronger the tides of human progress and
        peace among nations.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p>There is no greater prize than
